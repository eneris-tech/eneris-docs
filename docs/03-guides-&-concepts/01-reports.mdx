## Report writing best practices

Here are a couple of tips to optimize the length of inspection reports completed in Eneris:

1. Consider entering business details, SOP templates, custom report comments, etc. prior to your first on-site inspection.
2. Create the inspection (i.e., enter the property address, client name, date/time of the inspection, and any other general comments) prior to arriving on-site.
    - If the property is in an area where you know there is poor cellular reception enter `Offline Mode` prior to arriving on-site.
3. Using the `Additional Notes` field for longer text comments will result in better readability in the final report.
    - The `Description`, `Condition`, `Risk`, and `Location` fields benefit from shorter text entries.
4. Taking inspection photos in landscape (horizontal) mode, while not required, helps reduce the overall length of inspection reports.
