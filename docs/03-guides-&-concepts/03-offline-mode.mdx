# Offline mode

The Eneris [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eneris/id1448765778) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.eneris.ener.is&hl=en_CA) apps include an **Offline Mode**, which enables you to fully complete your inspection report without internet connection. It can then be synced to the cloud, once you have access to the internet again, before you share the completed report with your client. This is a great option if the inspection is in a rural area or in an area with no internet connection.

- Offline Mode works the same way on both iOS and Android devices.
- An internet connection is only necessary when you are ready to sync your report to the cloud.

:::info

Eneris supports up to a maximum of 20 offline reports per device.

e.g., If you currently have 20 offline reports on your device you will need to re-enable one to online mode before you can create a new offline report.

    - Depending on your inspection, this may be when you are in a certain area of the property or back at your own office.
2. Navigate to the **General** page of the inspection.
3. Select `Sync to Cloud - Ready`.
