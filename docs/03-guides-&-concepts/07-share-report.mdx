# Generate and share reports

Learn about the different options to share your finalized inspection report.

## PDF report, PDF summary, & Web report

Eneris can generate **PDF reports**, **PDF summaries**, and **web reports**.

The three options are not mutually exclusive. Feel free to generate one, two, or all three types of reports for each completed inspection.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="PDF report" label="PDF report" default>
    PDF reports are the traditional way to share a finalized inspection report with clients and other key contacts.

    :::info[Info]

    PDF reports are the full comprehensive report, which includes all inspected items even if there are no recommended actions or items appended to the summaries for the client.

    Use PDF reports when a full comprehensive report is requested or required by local regulations.

    :::

    ### Generate PDF reports
    1. Navigate into the desired inspection.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of the `General` tab.
    3. Select `Create PDF`.

    <img src={ImageGeneratePdfReport1} style={{ maxWidth: '600px', width: '100%' }} alt="Generate a PDF report" />

    4. `View PDF Report` will appear once the PDF has been generated.

    <img src={ImageGeneratePdfReport2} style={{ maxWidth: '600px', width: '100%' }} alt="View PDF report button appears after generating a PDF report" />

    5. The PDF report may now be shared.

    :::warning[Warning]

    This creates a PDF report based on the inspection results **at the time of the report generation**. If any changes are made to the inspection items the `Update PDF Report` button must be selected to generate a PDF report with the latest updates.

    :::

  </TabItem>

 <TabItem value="PDF summary" label="PDF summary">
    PDF summaries are a shortened version of the PDF report. Items in the PDF summaries have a recommended action for the client and/or a summary label was applied to the item.

    :::info[Info]

    The goal of the PDF summary is to highlight only the critical inspection information to your clients and other key contacts.

    Use PDF summaries when a shortened version of the PDF report may be beneficial to clients and other key contacts.

    :::

    2. Scroll to the bottom of the `General` tab.

    Web reports offer recipients a way to access the inspection results through a webpage URL.

    :::info[Info]

    You may also choose to auto-publish the web report after the invoice is settled. To enable this setting, see the `Auto-publish web report` section.

    :::

    ### Key advantages of web reports

    Web reports offer a few key advantages over PDF reports:

    1. **Video support**: recipients can play videos taken by the inspector.
    2. **Interactive charts**: recipients can filter the pie chart and bar chart, as desired.
    3. **Higher quality images**: web reports display images with less compression (i.e., clearer images).
    4. **Image zoom**: recipients can zoom in on images.
    5. **Auto-publish web report**: inspectors may enable a setting to automatically share the web report with clients once the invoice has been settled.

    :::warning[Warning]

    Web reports may not be the preferred option by clients, or other key contacts, if a traditional document is required. In those cases, consider the PDF report and/or PDF summary instead.

    :::

    ### Auto-publish web report
