## Auto publish reports on payment

Eneris allows for the [web version](https://ener.is/presentation/2ZNdNMSZkGz3qQkSq) of the inspection report to be published automatically when an invoice has been marked as settled.

To enable this:

1. Navigate to `Settings`.
2. Select `Presentation & PDFs`.
3. Select `Web Presentation Settings`.
4. Toggle the "Automatically Publish Report after Invoice is Settled” setting to `On`.

5. Select `Save Web Presentation Settings`.

## Payment collection fees

**Eneris** does not charge any payment collection fees.

**Stripe** charges a payment collection fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Additionally, Stripe charges a separate 0.4% invoicing fee per invoice.
- e.g., On a $500 USD payment Stripe will charge (($500 * 2.9% + $0.30) + ($500 * 0.4%)) = $16.80 USD.
- [Learn more about Stripe's fees on their website](https://stripe.com/en-ca/pricing).

## Payment deposit times

The first deposit may take 8-10 days for funds to clear due to Stripe's automated fraud detection systems. After that, 2-3 days can be expected for most transactions (depending on your banking institution or whether it is a weekend/holiday).

## Frequently asked payment processing questions

### Can I integrate this with accounting software such as Quickbooks, Excel, etc.?

Yes. If you require a more advanced accounting workflow, Stripe offers [third-party integrations](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/accounting) to tie payment processing into various accounting software. It also keeps permanent records of transactions, and can export all of your transaction information as needed.

### Will Eneris have access to my clients' credit card information?

No. Credit card processing is strictly handled by Stripe, which is a Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant transaction processor with enhanced security and fraud detection.
