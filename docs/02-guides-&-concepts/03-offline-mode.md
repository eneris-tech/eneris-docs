# Offline mode

The Eneris iOS and Android Apps include an **Offline Mode**, which enables you to fully complete your inspection report without internet connection. It can then be synced to the cloud, once you have access to the internet again, before you share the completed report with your client. This is a great option if the inspection is in a rural area or in an area with no internet connection.

- Offline Mode works the same way on both iOS and Android devices.
- An internet connection is only necessary when you are ready to sync your report to the cloud.

## How to enable Offline Mode

1. Create a new inspection or select the inspection you would like to perform in Offline Mode.
2. At the top of the **General** page select the **Use Offline** button.

When in Offline Mode, the report and all of its contents are automatically saved to your mobile device storage. To ensure your work is backed up and saved online you must sync your offline report to the cloud.

Follow these simple steps:

1. Find an area with cellular reception or wifi connection.
