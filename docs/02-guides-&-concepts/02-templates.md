# Templates

Templates allow for the customization of inspection lists, and the pre-filling of report fields. Once saved, they are available for selection when creating a new report, and in any report's `General` ****tab.

Templates are critical to an efficient inspection workflow on-site. Eneris allows for easy customization of templates and includes the most commonly used templates in US and Canadian markets to help you get started quickly.

Clicking the `Merge Template` button in any report's **General** tab will update the template with any updates made since the report was created, but will not overwrite report data.

## Add new items to a template

We recommend starting with a pre-loaded template and customizing it for your needs.

1. Select `View/Edit` button beside any template.

5. An option box will appear requesting the name of the new item to add, and whether the contents and pre-loaded narratives inside the item should be left empty, or copied from another item. For this example, the new item will be named “Solar Panels" and built from scratch.

## Pre-load text, graphics, and/or diagrams into templates

Expanding into an inspection subject while in template customization mode allows for the entry of text, photos, and videos. Any information or media entered in an inspection subject during this time will always be shown in any future reports created using that template unless manually removed.
