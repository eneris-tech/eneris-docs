    PDF reports are the traditional way to share a finalized inspection report with clients and other key contacts.

    :::info[Info]

    PDF reports are the full comprehensive report, which includes all inspected items even if there is no recommended action for the client.

    Use PDF reports when a full comprehensive report is requested or required by local regulations.

    :::

    ### Generate PDF reports
    1. Navigate into the desired inspection.
    2. Scroll to the bottom of the `General` tab.
    3. Select `Create PDF`*.
    ![generate-pdf-report-1.webp](./img/generate-pdf-report-1.webp)
    4. `View PDF Report` will appear once the PDF has been generated.
    ![generate-pdf-report-2.webp](./img/generate-pdf-report-2.webp)
    5. The PDF report may now be shared.

    ****Note**: This creates a PDF report based on the inspection results **at the time of the report generation**. If any changes are made to the inspection items the `Update PDF Report` button must be selected to generate a PDF report with the latest updates.*

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="PDF summary" label="PDF summary">
    PDF summaries are a shortened version of the PDF report. Items in the PDF summaries have a recommended action for the client and/or a summary label was applied to the item.

    :::info[Info]

    The goal of the PDF summary is to highlight only the critical inspection information to your clients and other key contacts.

    Use PDF summaries when a shortened version of the PDF report may be beneficial to clients and other key contacts.

  <TabItem value="Web report" label="Web report">
    Web reports offer recipients a way to access the inspection results through a webpage URL.

    ### Key advantages of web reports

    Web reports offer a few key advantages over PDF reports:

    1. **Video support**: recipients can play videos taken by the inspector.
    2. **Interactive charts**: recipients can filter the pie chart and bar chart, as desired.
    3. **Higher quality images**: web reports display images with less compression (i.e., clearer images).
    4. **Image zoom**: recipients can zoom in on images.
    5. **Auto-publish web report**: inspectors may enable a setting to automatically share the web report with clients once the invoice has been settled.

    :::warning[Warning]

    Web reports may not be the preferred option by clients, or other key contacts, if a traditional document is required. In those cases, consider the PDF report and/or PDF summary instead.
