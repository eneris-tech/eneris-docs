## How long will inspection reports be available in Eneris?

Inspection reports are kept indefinitely, unless specifically stated otherwise. We do not delete inspection reports to save space.

## Does Eneris share my inspection data and client information with third-parties such as insurance firms?

No. Eneris is solely dedicated to providing home inspectors with quality inspection software and does not have any incentive to share/sell your information.
